summary: |
    Add-on Facebook module.
description: |
    The Facebook module is used for connecting your application with
    Facebook. This module supports the following features:

    * Logging in to Facebook and authorizing your application with either the
      [Login button](Modules.Facebook.LoginButton) or programatically.

    * Making requests through the Facebook Graph API using the
      [requestWithGraphPath()](Modules.Facebook.requestWithGraphPath) method.

    * Sharing content using Facebook dialogs or the [Like button](Modules.Facebook.LikeButton).

    **Using Ti.Facebook with iOS 10 and Xcode 8**
    
    The paragraph about custom capabilities was only necessary between Titanium SDK 5.5.0 and 6.0.0. 
    Since 6.0.1.GA, we add the required capabilities automatically, so you don't need to curate your 
    own entitlements file anymore, which will avoid possible issues with concurring values. Please 
    ensure to use both SDK and CLI 6.0.1 (or later).

    **Note:** As of April 30th, 2015, Facebook no longer supports version 1.0 of their API, which
    includes the FQL and REST APIs.  Only the Graph APIs will be supported.

    **Migration from the Facebook module v4.x to v5.x**

    * **dialog() method** -- [presentWebShareDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentWebShareDialog) is
      deprecated and removed. The module will auto determine if you have a native Facebook App installed.
      [canPresentShareDialog()](Modules.Facebook.canPresentShareDialog) is also deprecated and removed.
      For more details, see 'Share Dialogs' and 'Request Dialogs' below.

    * **presentShareDialog() method** -- 'name' parameter is deprecated and replaced with 'title'.
      'caption' parameter is deprecated and removed.

    * **presentSendRequestDialog() method** -- 'to' parameter is deprecated and replaced with 'recipients'.
      There are a few new parameters as well, for more details,
      see [presentSendRequestDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentSendRequestDialog)

    The following APIs were removed due to changes in the native Facebook SDKs and
    removal of the Facebook v1.0 REST APIs:

    * **appid property** -- The Facebook application ID can no longer be set programmatically
      in the application.  Set the Facebook application ID in the `tiapp.xml` file.
      For more details, see 'Getting Started' below for more details.
    **Migration from the Facebook module v3.x to v4.x**

    The following APIs were removed due to changes in the native Facebook SDKs and
    removal of the Facebook v1.0 REST APIs:

    * **appid property** -- The Facebook application ID can no longer be set programmatically
      in the application.  Set the Facebook application ID in the `tiapp.xml` file.
      For more details, see 'Getting Started' below for more details.

    * **dialog() method** -- Use either
      [presentSendRequestDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentSendRequestDialog),
      [presentInviteDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentInviteDialog),
      [presentMessengerDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentMessengerDialog),
      [presentShareDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentShareDialog) or
      [presentWebShareDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentWebShareDialog).
      For more details, see 'Share Dialogs' and 'Request Dialogs' below.

    * **forceDialogAuth property** -- On Android, you can force dialog authorization with the
      [LoginButton.sessionLoginBehavior](Modules.Facebook.LoginButton.sessionLoginBehavior) property.

    * **publishInstall() method** -- The underlying Facebook API has been deprecated and
      is now handled automatically by the module.

    * **request() method** -- Due to the removal of the Facebook v1.0 APIs,
      all applications should call the Graph APIs instead. If you make any REST API calls
      with the `request()` method, transition to the Graph APIs and use the
      [requestWithGraphPath()](Modules.Facebook.requestWithGraphPath) method.

    * **reauthorize() method** -- To request additional Facebook permissions once the
      user authorizes the application, use either the
      [requestNewReadPermissions()](Modules.Facebook.requestNewReadPermissions) or
      [requestNewPublishPermissions()](Modules.Facebook.requestNewPublishPermissions).
      For more details, see "Manage Read and Write Permissions" below.

    * **LoginButton style property** -- Facebook redesigned its Login button and the
      style can no longer be changed.

    ## Getting Started

    To use the Facebook module, you need a Facebook application. To create a Facebook App,
    go to the Facebook Developer App: [developers.facebook.com/apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).

    -   Edit the `modules` section of your tiapp.xml file to include this module:

            <modules>
                <!-- Add the appropriate line(s) to your modules section -->
                <module platform="android">facebook</module>
                <module platform="iphone">facebook</module>
            </modules>

    -    Instantiate the module with the `require('facebook')` method, then make subsequent API calls
         with the new Facebook object.

             var fb = require('facebook');
             fb.permissions = [FACEBOOK_APP_PERMISSIONS]; // e.g. ['email']
             fb.initialize();
             fb.authorize();

    ### Additional iOS Setup Steps

    For the iOS platform, in the `ios plist dict` section of your `tiapp.xml` file, add the following keys:

      * `FacebookAppID` key with your Facebook App ID as the string value
      * `FacebookDisplayName` key with your Facebook App name (the one from `developer.facebook.com`) as the string value
      * `CFBundleURLTypes` key with a single-element array containing a dict as the value, where the dict contains:
          * `CFBundleURLName` key with the application app ID (same value as the `id` in the `tiapp.xml` file) as the string value
          * `CFBundleURLSchemes` key with a single-element array containing the Facebook App ID prefixed with `fb` as a string value

    For example:

            <ti:app>
                <ios>
                    <plist>
                        <dict>
                            <key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
                            <array>
                                <dict>
                                    <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
                                    <!-- Application ID same as the id value in the tiapp.xml file -->
                                    <string>APP_ID</string>
                                    <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
                                    <array>
                                        <!-- Prefix the Facebook App ID with 'fb' -->
                                        <string>fbFACEBOOK_APP_ID</string>
                                    </array>
                                </dict>
                            </array>
                            <key>FacebookAppID</key>
                            <!-- Facebook App ID -->
                            <string>FACEBOOK_APP_ID</string>
                            <key>FacebookDisplayName</key>
                            <!-- Facebook App Name from developer.facebook.com -->
                            <string>FACEBOOK_APP_NAME</string>
                        </dict>
                    </plist>
                </ios>
            </ti:app>

    To enable the use of Facebook dialogs (e.g., Login, Share), you also need to include the following key and values in `tiapp.xml`
    to handle the switching in and out of your app:

        <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>fbapi</string>
            <string>fb-messenger-api</string>
            <string>fbauth2</string>
            <string>fbshareextension</string>
        </array>

    If you are using the older Ti.Facebook Module 4.0.5 and wish to support iOS9, you will instead need to include the following key
    and values in `tiapp.xml` to handle the switching in and out of your app:

        <key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>fbapi</string>
            <string>fbapi20130214</string>
            <string>fbapi20130410</string>
            <string>fbapi20130702</string>
            <string>fbapi20131010</string>
            <string>fbapi20131219</string>
            <string>fbapi20140410</string>
            <string>fbapi20140116</string>
            <string>fbapi20150313</string>
            <string>fbapi20150629</string>
            <string>fbauth</string>
            <string>fbauth2</string>
            <string>fb-messenger-api20140430</string>
        </array>

    For iOS9 and titanium 5.0.0.GA and above, App Transport Security is disabled by default.
    If you choose to enable it, you have to set the following keys and values in `tiapp.xml` <ios> section for facebook module:

        <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
        <dict>
            <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
                <dict>
                    <key>facebook.com</key>
                        <dict>
                            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key> 
                            <true/>
                            <key>NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key> 
                            <false/>
                        </dict>
                    <key>fbcdn.net</key>
                        <dict>
                            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key> 
                            <true/>
                            <key>NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key>  
                            <false/>
                        </dict>
                    <key>akamaihd.net</key>
                        <dict>
                            <key>NSIncludesSubdomains</key> 
                            <true/>
                            <key>NSExceptionRequiresForwardSecrecy</key> 
                            <false/>
                        </dict>
                </dict>
        </dict>

    ### Additional Android Setup Steps

    Since Facebook module v4.0.0, for the Android platform, you need to:

      * Add the Facebook Login activity to the Android manifest
      * Add the Facebook App ID to the Android resources `string.xml` file
      * Create a Facebook proxy and associate it with the current active activity

    **Modify the Android Manifest**

    Add the Facebook Login activity to the `android manifest` section of your `tiapp.xml` file.
    You may need to add the `manifest` and `application` elements.

        <ti:app>
            <android xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
                <manifest>
                    <application>
                        <activity android:name="com.facebook.FacebookActivity" 
                                  android:theme="@android:style/Theme.Translucent.NoTitleBar" 
                                  android:label="YourAppName" 
                                  android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenLayout|screenSize|orientation" />
                        <meta-data android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId" android:value="@string/facebook_app_id"/>
                    </application>
                </manifest>
            </android>
        <ti:app>

    **Add the Facebook App ID to Android Resources**

    Add a string element to the `/platform/android/res/values/strings.xml` file with the `name`
    attribute set to `facebook_app_id` and the node text set to your Facebook App ID. Create the
    file if it does not exist.

        <resources>
            <string name="facebook_app_id">FACEBOOK_APP_ID</string>
        </resources>

    **Create a Facebook Proxy**

    Use the [createActivityWorker()](Modules.Facebook.createActivityWorker) method to create a
    Facebook proxy. Pass the method a dictionary with the `lifecycleContainer` property set to
    the current active instance of a standalone Window (window not contained in a tab group) or TabGroup.
    Create the proxy before calling the `open()` method on either the window or tab group.

    The Facebook module needs to hook into the lifecycle events of the current active activity
    in order to synchronize its state between various activities in the application, for example,
    to update the label of the Login button when the user logs in or out of Facebook.

    Attach the proxy to the Window or TabGroup object, so it does not get garbage collected.

        win.fbProxy = fb.createActivityWorker({lifecycleContainer: win});

    ## Module API Usage

    ### Facebook Login and Authorization

    To use Facebook, a user must logged into Facebook and explicitly authorize the application to
    perform certain actions, such as accessing profile information or posting status messages.

    There are two ways to initiate the login process:

    * Call [authorize](Modules.Facebook.authorize) to prompt the user to login and authorize
      the application. Before calling this method, set the <Modules.Facebook.permissions> property
      if additional permissions are needed.

    * Create a Facebook [LoginButton](Modules.Facebook.LoginButton) to allow the user to
      log in if desired. You can add either read permissions or write permissions,
      otherwise the default is to request for the `public_profile` permission.
      Note that Facebook does not support setting both `readPermissions` and `publishPermissions`
      properties at the same time when using the LoginButton.

    Which approach you take depends on your UI and how central Facebook is to your
    application.

    ### Manage Read and Write Permissions

    In order to read or write content to a user's Facebook page, you need to request permission from
    the user.  You can either request permissions when the user authorizes your application or
    request permissions on the fly.

    Before the user logs in and authorizes the application, you can request permissions for the
    application to use by either:

      * Setting the <Modules.Facebook.permissions> property if you are using `authorize()` method to
        have the user login and authorize the application.
      * Setting either the [readPermissions](Modules.Facebook.LoginButton.readPermissions) or
        [publishPermissions](Modules.Facebook.LoginButton.publishPermissions) on an instance of a LoginButton.
        Do not set both properties or the application will throw an error.

    For a complete list of permissions, see the [official Facebook Permissions Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/)

    **Refresh Application Permissions**

    Since the user can selectively turn application permissions on and off from their Facebook
    page, the application may need to refresh its granted permissions.

    To refresh the application's permissions, call the
    [refreshPermissionsFromServer()](Modules.Facebook.refreshPermissionsFromServer) method, then
    listen for the <Modules.Facebook.tokenUpdated> event to be notified when permissions are updated.

        fb.addEventListener('tokenUpdated', function(e) {
            Ti.API.info('Updated permissions: ' + JSON.stringify(fb.permissions));
        });
        fb.refreshPermissionsFromServer();


    **Request Additional Read Permissions**

    To request additional read permissions once the user authorizes your application, use the
    [requestNewReadPermissions()](Modules.Facebook.requestNewReadPermissions) method.

    Check the <Modules.Facebook.permissions> property to make sure the user accepted the request for
    additional permissions.

        var fb = require('facebook');
        fb.requestNewReadPermissions(['read_stream','user_hometown', etc...], function(e) {
            if (e.success) {
                fb.requestWithGraphPath(...);
            } else if (e.cancelled) {
                ....
            } else {
                Ti.API.debug('Failed authorization due to: ' + e.error);
            }
        });

    **Request Additional Write Permissions**

    To request additional write permissions once the user authorizes your application, use the
    [requestNewPublishPermissions()](Modules.Facebook.requestNewPublishPermissions) method.
    Note that in addition to passing the permissions to request, you need to also pass an `AUDIENCE_*`
    constant to indicate the default audience when positing content.

    Check the <Modules.Facebook.permissions> property to make sure the user accepted the request for
    additional permissions.

        var fb = require('facebook');
        fb.requestNewPublishPermissions(['read_stream','user_hometown', etc...], fb.AUDIENCE_FRIENDS, function(e) {
            if (e.success) {
                fb.requestWithGraphPath(...);
            } else if (e.cancelled) {
            ....
            } else {
                Ti.API.debug('Failed authorization due to: ' + e.error);
            }
        });


    ### Share Dialogs

    The Share dialog prompts a person to publish an individual story or an Open Graph story
    to their timeline. This does not require the user to authorize your app or any extended permissions,
    so it is the easiest way to enable sharing.

    The Share dialog uses the Facebook apps interface, so the Facebook app needs to be installed.  If
    the Facebook app is not installed, the application can use the Feed dialog that presents the
    dialog in a web-based view as a back up if the Share dialog is not available.

    To present a Share dialog to a user, use the <Modules.Facebook.canPresentShareDialog> property to
    check if the application can use the Share dialog. If the application supports the Share dialog,
    call the [presentShareDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentShareDialog) to present it, else call the
    [presentWebShareDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentWebShareDialog) method to present the Feed dialog.

    Pass either method parameters you want to add to the post, such as a link or picture, or to
    share the user's status, do not pass any parameters to the methods.

    To monitor if the share request succeeded or not, listen to the <Modules.Facebook.shareCompleted>
    event.

            fb.addEventListener('shareCompleted', function (e) {
                if (e.success) {
                    Ti.API.info('Share request succeeded.');
                } else {
                    Ti.API.warn('Failed to share.');
                }
            });

            fb.presentShareDialog({
                link: 'https://appcelerator.com/',
                title: 'great product',
                description: 'Titanium is a great product',
                picture: 'http://www.appcelerator.com/wp-content/uploads/scale_triangle1.png'
            });


    For details on the Share dialog, see the
    [official Facebook Share Dialogs documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sharing/reference/share-dialog).

    ### Requests Dialog

    A request dialog allows a user to invite another user to use your application.
    Facebook will send a private message to the recipient.
    The typical use case is to invite another user to play a game.
    If you want to invite people to your application which is not a game, use the
    [presentInviteDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentInviteDialog) method instead.

    To send a request to a user, call the
    [presentSendRequestDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentSendRequestDialog) method and pass the
    method a dictionary with the `message` property set the message you want to send the invited user.
    Optional: You can set the `title` property with a title string. You can also set the `data` property
    with a dictionary of custom parameters. If you want to preselect users to send invite to, you can set
    the `to` property with string of values that are facebook ids seperated by comma.

    To monitor if the request succeeded or not, listen to the <Modules.Facebook.requestDialogCompleted> event.


            fb.addEventListener('requestDialogCompleted', function (e) {
                if (e.success) {
                    Ti.API.info('request succeeded.');
                } else {
                    Ti.API.warn('Failed to share.');
                }
            });

            fb.presentSendRequestDialog({
                message: 'Go to https://appcelerator.com/',
                title: 'Invitation to Appcelerator',
                recipients: ['123456789', '123456788'],
                data: {
                    badge_of_awesomeness: '1',
                    social_karma: '5'
                }
            });

    For details on request dialogs see the
    [official Facebook Request Dialogs documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/games/requests/v2.2).

    ### Messenger Dialog

    A messenger dialog allows a user to send content to the Facebook Messenger using your application.

    To send a message to a user, call the [presentMessengerDialog()](Modules.Facebook.presentMessengerDialog) method
    and pass the method a dictionary with the optional values "title", "description", "link", "to", "placeID"
    and "referal".

    ### Messenger Button

    The Messenger button provides a quick mechanism for users to share content to the Facebook Messenger.
    A click on the button can share the content to multiple users.

    To create a Messenger button, call the [createMessengerButton()](Modules.Facebook.createMessengerButton)
    method and pass the "mode" and "style" properties:

        var messengerButton = fb.createMessengerButton({
            mode: fb.MESSENGER_BUTTON_MODE_RECTANGULAR
            style: fb.MESSENGER_BUTTON_STYLE_BLUE
        });
        win.add(messengerButton);

    For more information, see the [MessengerButton API reference](Modules.Facebook.MessengerButton).

    ### Like Button

    The Like button provides a quick mechanism for users to share content. A click on the button
    will share the content on the user's Facebook page.

    To create a Like button, call the [createLikeButton()](Modules.Facebook.createLikeButton) method
    and pass it a dictionary with the `objectID` assigned to either a URL or Open Graph object ID
    you want to share. Add the button instance to a view to display it.

        var likeButton = fb.createLikeButton({
            objectID: "https://www.facebook.com/appcelerator"
        });
        win.add(likeButton);

    For more information, see the [LikeButton API reference](Modules.Facebook.LikeButton).

examples:

  - title: Alloy Example
    example: |
        Displays the Facebook Login and Like buttons in a window.

        `app/alloy.js`:

            // Make API calls to Alloy.Globals.Facebook
            Alloy.Globals.Facebook = require('facebook');

        `app/views/index.xml`:

            <Alloy>
                <Window backgroundColor="white">
                    <LoginButton id="fbLogin" module="facebook" top="25" />
                    <LikeButton id="fbLike" module="facebook" top="100" />
                </Window>
            </Alloy>

        `app/controllers/index.js`:

            $.fbLike.objectID = "http://www.facebook.com/appcelerator";
            if (OS_ANDROID) {
                $.index.fbProxy = Alloy.Globals.Facebook.createActivityWorker({lifecycleContainer: $.index});
            }
            $.index.open();

  - title: Authorize
    example: |

        Shows official Facebook dialog for logging in the user and prompting the user to approve your
        requested permissions.  Listen for the module's [login](Modules.Facebook.login) event to
        determine whether the request succeeded.

            var fb = require('facebook');
            fb.initialize();
            fb.addEventListener('login', function(e) {
                if (e.success) {
                    alert('login from uid: '+e.uid+', name: '+ JSON.parse(e.data).name);
                    label.text = 'Logged In = ' + fb.loggedIn;
                }
                else if (e.cancelled) {
                    // user cancelled
                    alert('cancelled');
                }
                else {
                    alert(e.error);
                }
            });
            fb.authorize();

  - title: Logout
    example: |

        Logout the user and forget the authorization token.  The
        [logout](Modules.Facebook.logout) event is fired after the user is logged out.

            fb.addEventListener('logout', function(e) {
                alert('Logged out');
            });
            fb.logout();


  - title: Authorize/Logout Using the Facebook LoginButton
    example: |

        You can use the the native Facebook [LoginButton](Modules.Facebook.LoginButton)
        to allow the user to log in as required. The button updates its state automatically depending
        on whether the user is logged in or not.  When the user is logged in, then the button
        will show "Logout", and vice-versa.

        Note that you don't need to set a click listener or anything else on the button.
        To be notified when the user logs in or out, add event listeners for the
        [login](Modules.Facebook.login) and [logout](Modules.Facebook.logout) events
        provided by the Facebook module, as in the example below.

            // Don't forget to set your requested permissions, else the login button won't be effective.
            var win = Ti.UI.createWindow({backgroundColor: 'white'});
            var fb = require('facebook');

            fb.addEventListener('login', function(e) {
                if (e.success) {
                    alert('Logged in');
                }
            });
            fb.addEventListener('logout', function(e) {
                alert('Logged out');
            });

            if (Ti.Platform.name === 'android') {
                win.fbProxy = fb.createActivityWorker({lifecycleContainer: win});
            }

            // Add the button.  Note that it doesn't need a click event listener.
            win.add(fb.createLoginButton({
                    readPermissions: ['read_stream','email'],
                    top: 50
            }));

            win.open()

  - title: Simple Graph API Call
    example: |

        This example makes a call to the "me" graph path, which represents the current
        user. The JSON results are simply displayed in an alert.  This example assumes
        the user is already logged in. You can check this with <Modules.Facebook.loggedIn>.

            fb.requestWithGraphPath('me', {}, 'GET', function(e) {
                if (e.success) {
                    alert(e.result);
                } else if (e.error) {
                    alert(e.error);
                } else {
                    alert('Unknown response');
                }
            });

  - title: Post a Photo Using the Graph API from the Gallery.
    example: |

        This example posts a photo to the user's account using the Graph API.
        This requires the "publish_actions" permission.

            var B1_TITLE = 'Upload Photo from Gallery with Graph API';
            var b1 = Ti.UI.createButton({
                title:B1_TITLE,
                left: 10, right: 10, top: 0, height: 80
            });

            b1.addEventListener('click', function() {
                Titanium.Media.openPhotoGallery({
                    success:function(event)
