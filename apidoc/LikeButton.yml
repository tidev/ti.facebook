name: Modules.Facebook.LikeButton
summary: A Facebook Like button.
description: |
    Use the [createLikeButton()](Modules.Facebook.createLikeButton) method to create a Like button.
    You must set the <Modules.Facebook.LikeButton.objectId> before the button is rendered.

    By default, the Like button displays a button with a social sentence ('x number of users like y')
    next to it.  To change the Like button style, set the
    <Modules.Facebook.LikeButton.likeViewButton> property.

    The Like button does not require a click event handler or any listeners.
    Click events on the button are automatically handled by the Facebook module.

    Facebook policies state:

    <blockquote>
    Please note that you will have to submit your integration
    of the Like button for review via the Status and Review tab in the App Dashboard.
    You will also need to abide by our Platform Policy 4.14: if you use the Like button
    on iOS or Android, don't collect or use any information from it.
    </blockquote>

    See the [official Facebook Like Button documentation for Android](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/like-button)
    or the [official Facebook Like Button documentation for iOS](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/like-button)
    for more information.

    #### Android Platform Notes

    If the `objectId` property is not set before the button is rendered,
    the Like button will not be displayed.

    #### iOS Platform Notes

    Do not set the `width` or `height` properties of the button to the `Ti.UI.SIZE` dimension.
    This prevents the button from being clicked.

    If the `objectId` property is not set before the button is rendered,
    the application will throw an error.
