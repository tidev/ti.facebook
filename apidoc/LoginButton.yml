name: Modules.Facebook.LoginButton
summary: A Facebook Login Button.
description: |
    Use the [createLoginButton()](Modules.Facebook.createLoginButton) method
    to create a Login button. If you want to request user permissions when the
    user logs in, set either the <Modules.Facebook.LoginButton.readPermissions> or
    <Modules.Facebook.LoginButton.publishPermissions> property, but do not set both.  If both
    properties are set, the application will throw an exception.  If neither property is set, by
    default, only the `user_profile` permission is requested.

    The Login button does not require a click event handler or any listeners.
    Click events on the button are automatically handled by the Facebook module.

    The button changes its label to reflect the current state of the Facebook
    session.  For example, if the user is already logged in, the button will show "Logout".

    #### Android Platform Notes

    In Android, the button's width will change depending on the current state it is in. When
    logged out, it will show "Log in with Facebook" and its width will match the length of
    the text. When logged in, it will show "Log out" and its width will match the length of
    the text.

    #### iOS Platform Notes

    In iOS, the width and height of the button can be changed using the `width` and `height` property.
    The Facebook SDK 4.19.0 and later (used in Ti.Facebook 5.4.0 and later) provides an updated Login 
    button. The title now is "Continue with Facebook" instead of "Login with Facebook" and the recommended 
    height is 28px. Please always specify a height for best results.

        Requested read permissions.

        [official Facebook Permissions Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/).

        Sets the permissions to use when the session is opened. The permissions here can
        only be read permissions. If any publish permissions are included, the login
        attempt by the user will fail. The LoginButton can only be associated with either
        read permissions or publish permissions, but not both. Using both the `readPermissions`
        and `publishPermissions` property on the same instance of LoginButton will result in an
        exception being thrown.

        Set this property before the session is open. If this property is set
        after the session is opened, and the list of permissions passed in is not a subset
        of the permissions granted during the authorization, it will log an error.

        Since the session can be automatically opened when the LoginButton is constructed, it is
        important to always pass in a consistent set of permissions to this property, or manage
        the setting of permissions outside of the LoginButton class altogether (by managing
        the session explicitly).
